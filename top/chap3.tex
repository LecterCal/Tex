\begin{definition}{cover}
A collection $\mathcal{A}$ of subsets of a space $X$ is said to cover $X,$ or to be a covering of $X,$ if the union of the elements of $\mathcal{A}$ is equal to $X .$ It is called an open covering of $X$ if its elements are open subsets of $X$
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}{compact}
A space $X$ is said to be compact if every open covering $\mathcal{A}$ of $X$ contains a finite subcollection that also covers $X$
\end{definition}
\begin{theorem}
Every closed subspace of a compact space is compact.
